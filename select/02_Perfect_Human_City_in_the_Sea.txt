found myself in the rightplace at the righttimetoshedsome light onthislife.
I cannot explain the way things happen to us, but I can say this twice.
Fuck you, thisis the waythings are.
Right now, I have completely dissolved this discontent from my heart, from my mind.
I am fine withoutan answer.
Life goes on.
I found myself in between the linesI said I would nevercross.
No longer afraid I am seizing the days ahead.
Right now, I have completely dissolved this discontent from my heart, from my mind.
I am fine withoutan answer.
Life goes on.
I can't change the worldI can only change myself.
Withoutan answer, life goes on
